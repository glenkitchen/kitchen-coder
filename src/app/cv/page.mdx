## About

I am a software developer with extensive experience in enterprise business software.  
I am also the co-founder of a software development agency.

I bring a unique combination of specialized business process expertise and deep technical skills. I have played a leading role in developing solutions for accounting, manufacturing, distribution, and retail.

I am always seeking ways to empower developers to ship faster:

- In the past, this involved creating in-house, low-code solutions.
- Today, I focus on leveraging AI-assisted coding tools and techniques to drive exponential improvements in productivity.

This was a hybrid role with accounting and IT duties.

On the accounting side I was initially the cost accountant and thereafter the management accountant responsible for overseeing the accounts department.

I was also involved in various IT projects which were my introduction to the world of software development:
Manage roll out of Syspro ERP, oversee development of in-house shop floor applications, develop in-house sales reporting applications.
