## About

I am a software developer with a particular focus on enterprise business software.

I have a combination of specialized business process expertise and deep technical skills; and I have played a leading role in the development of accounting, manufacturing, distribution and retail solutions.

As a coder, my emphasis is platform development, enabling other developers to deliver feature, at speed.  
Lately, this has also entailed the effective use of AI-assisted coding.

As an architect, I architect for long-term longevity and commercial trade-offs.
